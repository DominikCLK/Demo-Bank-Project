# ‚ö°Ô∏èDemo Bank Automated Testing

## Overview

This project aims to ensure the reliability and functionality of the [Demo Bank](https://demo-bank.vercel.app/) website through automated testing. Leveraging the Playwright framework with TypeScript, we strive to streamline the testing process, catching potential issues early on and maintaining a robust and error-free web application.

## üöÄ Features

- **End-to-End Testing:** Simulate real user interactions to validate the entire user journey.

- **Scenario Coverage:** Cover various user journeys, including login to account, fund transfers, and balance verification.

- **Continuous Integration:** Integrate the testing suite into the continuous integration pipeline for quick feedback.

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **Playwright Framework:** A powerful automation framework for browsers.

- **TypeScript:** Enhance code readability and maintainability with strong typing and modern features.

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automate testing on code changes for a continuous feedback loop.
